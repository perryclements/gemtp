============

Fortran 90 version for gfortran.
To compile:

$ cd sources
$ make setup
...
$ make

to clear the projects, thus deleting ../modules/labcom.f90, ../sources/newmods.f90 and ../sources/gcc

to test a data case file use

$ gcc/gemtp < ../benchmarks/data_case_001.dat

this data case is from page 3-9 to page 3-21 of the EMTP workbook (EL-4651).
