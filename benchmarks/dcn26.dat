C   7th  of 19 subcases  demonstrates proper working of superposition of phasor
C   solutions for a constant-parameter, distributed line.   This  first was made
C   to work around sunset on  15 Nov 1998.  Two hours later, the switch was made
C   to work.   It had a bug of its own.   The switch is permanently closed,  and
C   does not change the answer.   Its addition merely demonstrates that switches
C   now are tolerated.   Still no frequency-dependent line, however.   That will
C   be left for the expert (BPA's Dr. Tsu-huei Liu), if she thinks it is doable.

C   8th  of 19 subcases is like the preceding, only for 3-phase distributed line
C   modeling rather than single phase.  For simplicity,  the line is taken to be
C   continuously transposed.   So,  to make the solution interesting,  the  load
C   is unbalanced slightly.  The effect is substantial (must be near resonance).
C   As phasor output is becoming substantial,  illustrate lack of phasor output.
C   About receiving end voltages (1st plot), phase b is dominated by fundamental
C   whereas phase c is dominated by the harmonic.  On the other hand,  phase a
C   is a nice mixture of the two.  Done.  WSM,  15 November 1998  19:52

C   and yours truly (WSM) force this through together on December 2, 1998.  The

C      11th of 19 subcases is like 9th,  only with the single-phase JMarti line
C      replaced by a Semlyen line.  BPA's Dr. Tsu-huei Liu and WSM force this
C      through together on December 8, 1998.  The same line data was used to
C      produce the Semlyen branch cards as was used to produce the Marti branch

BEGIN NEW DATA CASE
C      12th  of 19 subcases is like 10th,  only with the three-phase JMarti line
C      replaced by a 3-phase Semlyen line.   The Semlyen branch cards are copied
C      from  DC-31.  Note  XOPT and COPT have been set to 60 Hz to match the
C      branch cards at the 1st of 2 frequencies.  Unlike the high-order JMarti
C      model, 2nd-order Semlyen involves substantial error, & is more biased
C      toward a match at power frequency.  So,  the switch to 60 favors smoother
C      Semlyen operation at the dominant frequency.  Of course, the second freq
C      of 120 Hz is not well fitted,  but it does not dominate,  so error is of
C      less importance.  The resulting plots are reasonably smooth.  If really
C      smooth plots are wanted,  change the 2nd frequency to the 1st,  so that
C      the superposition has the effect of doubling power-frequency excitation.
C      This is an independent, separate way to verify the superposition while
C      avoiding error that is associated with the constant-inductance phasor
C      representation of Semlyen modeling.

C   13th of 19 subcases is a generalization of the 5th.  Superposition of phasor
C   solutions is illustrated for simple series R-L-C elements.  But here, we
C   add a 3rd harmonic.  Use 1, 2, and 3 Hz.  The resulting solution has period
C   1 Hz,  of course,  so simulating and plotting to 2 sec shows 2 cycles.  The
C   periodicity is seen by comparing step 0 with 100 with 200 (very close).

C   14th  of 19 subcases is a combination of the preceding.  Use three single-
C   phase lines:  1) Constant-parameter from 7th subcase;  2) JMARTI from 9th
C   subcase;  and  3) Semlyen from the 11th.  Connect all 3 in series to verify
C   that they all can coexist.  Also, use 3 harmonics: 50, 75, and 100 Hz.  The
C   result is seen to be perfectly smooth.  Terminal nodes  SEND  and  REC  are
C   driven by voltage sources,  so voltage here indicates nothing. But interior
C   nodes  SEM  and  REC  provide a good measure of smoothness.  The period is
C   equal to 40 msec, note, because 75 Hz has a period of 13.3333 msec.  Two
C   cycles at 50 Hz, 3 cycles at 75 Hz, and 4 cycles at 100 Hz  ---  all are
C   equal to 40 msec.  So, step 400 agrees closely with step 0.  Consider the

C   Note about preceding, third, excitation set.  Because there is no source
C   having T-start zero or positive,  ATP logic that began 15 December 1998
C   will internally copy all sources of all preceding excitation sets, changing
C   T-start to zero in order that these sources become effective on the first
C   time step.  In effect,  the following sources are added internally:

C   But note carefully that this helpful feature relies upon lack of any source
C   other than phasor excitation.  If any source of the final data set has zero
C   or positive T-start,  there will be no such internal addition.  If the user
C   specifies one,  he must specify all sources having T-start non-negative.

C      16th of 19 subcases illustrates  KILL = 222  as mentioned in the January,
C      1999, newsletter.   The  R-L-C  connection of the preceding subcase is
C      modified to connect to a second generator rather than ground.  The 2nd
C      generator,  GEN2,  has a different frequency than the 1st.  Prior to
C      correction on November 17th,  execution continued in spite of the mixing
C      of frequencies through a nonlinear element.  Now, the error is trapped.
C      Note no use of superposition,  which is an extraneous complication.  A
C      single frequency is all that is required to demonstrate the phenomenon.

C        The slope has been reduced from  .05  to  .02  and the offset has been

C        times,  providing different formulas for an arbitrary number of ranges
C        of KNT.  If the condition of the first  ELSEIF  was not satisfied, the
C        second would be checked, etc. in order from top to bottom.  If none is
C        satisfied when  ELSE  finally was reached,  the formula below  ELSE
C        would be used.
ELSE { Alternatively (if none of preceding conditions were satisfied), use this:
C        Control reaches this point only if no preceding condition is satisfied.
C        I.e.,  for 7 < KNT.  The slope and offset will be changed once again,
