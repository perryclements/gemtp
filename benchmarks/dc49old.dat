C     BENCHMARK DC-49
C     Companion case to DC-32, which had  MEMSAV=1  use.   Development was first
C     documented  in  Volume X  EMTP Memoranda,  3 July 1980,  Pagination  MSDO.
C     Node  LOADA  has a one-ohm resistor connected to  FAULT,  and this in turn
C     is connected to ground via switch number one.  This fault switch was  open
C     during  DC-32,  but will here be closed at  12 msec  (the  1st step beyond
C     the backed-off switching time of  11.99 msec).
