C          Small impedance branches are used (prior to "M34." generalized switch
C          logic) to isolate switches from each other at  "POLEA".   R = 5 ohms.
C          Although in theory such isolation is no longer required,  do  not try
C          to remove these 9 resistors,  since  they  provide necessary damping.
C          Note that these resistors are not of negligible value:
  CATH1 POLEA                5.0
  CATH2 POLEA CATH1 POLEA
  CATH3 POLEA CATH1 POLEA
C          More small impedances used for switch isolation at node  "POLEB", and
C          also at the transformer secondary. Half the value of "POLEA" is used,
C          for balance:

C      2-conductor distributed line connects  "POLE"  with  "LOAD".   Inductance
C      parameters  are  5.8  and  1.6 millihenries for the ground and sky modes,
C      respectively.  Length is five miles.  Values are typical for 500 kV line:

C                            Large stray capacitance ties the dc side to ground:

C          Load on dc side is parallel 200 ohm R and 100 microfarad capacitance:
  LOADA LOADB               200.
