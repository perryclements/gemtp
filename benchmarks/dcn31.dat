C    1st of ?? subcases illustrates creation of new C-like .PL4 file that was
C    inspired by Massimo Ceraolo of the University of Pisa in Italy.  The date
C    of addition is 11 March 1999,  and mention should be found in later issues 
C    of the newsletter.  There are no dynamics.  The network is resistive, and
C    all voltages and currents are sinusoidal.  An attempt has been made to
C    involve different types of variables: 1 branch voltage first, then a power,
C    then two node voltages,  then a branch current,  then energy,  and finally,     
C    a TACS signal (also power).  The new C-like format should be better than 
C    the old for concurrent, SPY-like plotting.

C  First  4     output variables are electric-network voltage differences (upper voltage minus lower voltage);
C  Next   2     output variables are branch currents (flowing from the upper node to the lower node);
C  Next   1     output variables belong to TACS (with "TACS" an internally-added upper name of pair).
C Branch power  consumption (power  flow, if a switch) is treated like a branch voltage for this grouping (1  variables);
C Branch energy consumption (energy flow, if a switch) is treated like a branch current for this grouping (1  variables).
