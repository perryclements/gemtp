C     Demonstration of random switch opening: A Monte Carlo ("STATISTICS") study
C     only with random opening rather than the more common closing.  The network
C     is  purely  resistive by design,  in order that switch current is known to
C     have a current zero at  0.625 seconds.   There are 3 parallel, independent
C     networks radially branched off of  generator  GEN  to nodes  LOAD,  LOAD1,
C     and  LOAD2.   All 3 involve statistical opening.  If  a switch opens early
C     (before .625 sec), then negative peak of  -100  at  t = 3/4  will be kept
C     for extrema.  If not (nearly half the time, since the mean of the switches
C     shorting  LOAD,  LOAD1,  and  LOAD2  to ground is  t = 0.6,  which is very
C     close to the current zero),   the opening is delayed until  t = .875,  and
C     then the peak is  +30.9  at the end time  t = 0.9 seconds.   Why?  This is
C     because frequency equal to  2 Hz  and use of  BEGIN PEAK VALUE SEARCH   at
C     0.525  means  that we ignore the positive peak at  0.5 sec,  and  we never
C     make  the next one at  1.0 sec  since  TMAX = 0.9 sec.   The negative peak
C     at 0.750 sec is seen only for the early opening at 0.625 sec.   As for the
C     randomness,  we  have  mixed random closing and opening as an illustration
C     of this new capability that first worked on  9 July 1987.   All the actual
C     switchings of  interest (three) use opening,  whereas the reference switch
C     (one of two components of the opening time) uses random closing.   Because
C     of use of built-in random numbers  (data value  XMAXMX  is negative),  all
C     computers  should  produce identical results.   Confirmation of the actual
C     opening times can be deduced from the resultant peak voltage:
C        1) For opening at 0.63 sec, source voltage appears at this time, and it
C           lasts through the end of the simulation.  The negative  peak  occurs
C           at time  0.75 sec,  and this shows up in the printout  (the  extrema
C           will have a value of  -100.0  volts).
C        2) For opening at  0.875 sec,  source voltage appears at this time, and
C           only last through the positive rise toward the peak at 1.0 sec.  But
C           this  rise is prematurely ended at time  TMAX = 0.90 sec,  when  the
C           voltage is  30.901699 volts,  and this will be the extrema.
C     Not all computers require that variable  NSEED  of  columns 73-80  of  the
C     STATISTICS miscellaneous data card be punched,  meaning  use  of the fixed
C     seed.  But Apollo does require this,  since built-in random numbers are no
C     different than installation-dependent ones:  the VAX-11 algorithm is used.

C   The preceding  Ie = 40  advanced the LOAD2 switch-opening time slightly:

C   With Ie = 40 amps :  Open switch  "LOAD2 "  to  "      "  after  6.00000000E-01  sec.
C   But this was just base case output.  Extrema were not affected.  Adding five
C   amps (40 becomes 45) affected the extrema,  so data is left this way.

C    This is using  Ie = 45 amps.  Using an older version of ATP with this new
C    data should produce the following different and wrong answer:
C                        -100.         -100.   30.901699437495    -100.

C    How old?  A month or more.  The wrong answer corresponds to use of the
C    current margin  Ie = 0  with either the old or the new program.  As
C    pointed out by Prof. Mustafa Kizilcay about a month ago using other data,
C    ATP seemed to be ignoring current margin for the 2nd and later shots.  In
C    response,  WSM proposed avoidance by making  TENERG  of  STARTUP  negative
C    (simply append a minus sign).  This was prior to correction of code, of
C    course.  That 3rd output variable is the voltage at node  LOAD2  ---
C    the node of the switch that has current chopping.

C      20 which increased from 3 to 4.  The change of summary statistics is big:
C        Old solution :  Mean = 7.15001430E-01 ...   Variance = 1.26750507E-01
C        New solution :  Mean = 8.45001690E-01 ...   Variance = 8.45003380E-02
C      This is for  "Grouped data."  The  "Ungrouped data"  are comparable.
C   Add "FIND" usage with  "DISK"  output to demonstrate that  Ie  of the  LOAD2
C   switch is not erased on 17 March 2007.  Prior to correction of DICTAB,
C   this was the case according to a trouble report from Orlando Hevia.

C   Historical note.  Upon learning that we had corrected Ie treatment for Prof.
C   Mustafa Kizilcay, Orlando Hevia reminded the workers in Portland that he had
C   submitted a comparable complaint earlier.  In his mail archive,  he found a
C   message to BPA having time stamp   Fri, 28 Jan 2005 17:37:39 -0300.  Without
C   doubt,  Orlando's complaint was the same,  fundamentally.  Why it was not
C   handled at the time remains unclear.  In that an additional problem with
C   DISK  output was noted,  Orlando's complaint was more complete.  How did
C   Orlando first note the phenomenon?  He explained :  "The first users that
C   discovered a problem with Ie and 3333 switches are a couple from Uruguay .."

BEGIN NEW DATA CASE
C       4th of 5 subcases is unrelated to other subcases other than that it
C       involves Monte Carlo simulation.  It is added  27 November 2002  to
C       demonstrate that  KIZILCAY F-DEPENDENT (KFD)  modeling is compatible
C       with  STATISTICS  (and/or  SYSTEMATIC  or  START AGAIN,  although only
C       STATISTICS  is demonstrated).  As first reported by Ricardo Tenorio of
C       ABB in Vasteras, Sweden,  there was incompatibility (execution would
C       hang after the 1st energization had begun) prior to correction on
C       16 November 2002.  Ricardo's initial complaint was about minimum dT (see
C       the January, 2003, newsletter),  but shortly thereafter, privately, he
C       reported inability to use STATISTICS switches with KFD data.  The data
C       used here is the same as will be found in the 7th subcase of DC-23.
C       Step size  dT  is plenty big,  so there is no question of instability
C       caused by roundoff error.  A switch has been added in series with the
C       voltage source,  and the associated mean and standard deviation are
C       arbitrarily chosen to give a nice distribution of 4 energizations.
C       Finally,  the sinusoidal source has been restored to 60 Hz (in DC-23,
C       50 Hz was used in order that the period be a rounder number),  and the
C       angle has been rotated so the voltage upon closure is small.  I.e.,
C       the closures are artificially soft, intentionally, so the base case
C       plot has no big spike at 4 msec.

C   The preceding base current of 4K amps is close to the peak value of the
C   base-case (no-variance) solution.  It results in per unit values of a
C   little more than 1.  Using default compartment size of .05, this results
C   in reasonable compartment numbers,  and a pleasing dispersion of results:

C       5th of 5 subcases is a modified version of the 1st.  The  FIND  command
C       is added as earlier illustrated in DC-24.  That already illustrates the
C       use of  DISK  to create deterministic data  SHOT*.DAT  corresponding to
C       an  EXCLUDE-d  shot.  But what DC-24 does not illustrate is  RESIMULATE
C       to simulate the just-created data.  Also missing was random opening and
C       use of the optional  /MEMSAV  switch.  So, provide these here.  This
C       data subset is added  6 October 2002.  Until 27 November 2002,  it was
C       the 4th subcase.  Note it always must be last.

FIND  { Enter interactive search for which shot and which variable gave extremum
C   Normally the user does not know which shot he wants,  so he first will use
C   EXCLUDE  to find the worst transients,  and then he wants data for this.
C   See DC-24 for this technique.  But it also is possible for the user manually
C   to name the shot of interest.  This is what is done here:
C EXCLUDE  { Repeat the preceding search after 1st excluding the just-found shot
C                       < Shot #   Cols 25-32 are I8 data for shot # of interest

RESIMULATE { Abort this data case.  Begin with SHOT0001.DAT just created by DISK
C   Any data card following RESIMULATE should be ignored.  So, this is a good
C   place to add miscellaneous comments.  Begin these with mention of  /OPEN
C   ---  another flag of the  DISK  subcommand that is not being illustrated.
C   Because there is no  /OPEN  qualifier,  $OPEN  and  $CLOSE  cards will be
C   converted to comment cards.  If  /OPEN  were added,  they would be passed
C   through without modification.   Another unused feature is  /FULL  (see DC-24
C   for an illustration).  Lack of  /FULL  means that switch times will be
C   optimally encoded but with a leading blank byte.  This provides separation
C   from what precedes the number.  Yes, one digit is being given up, but it is
C   highly unlikely that this will make any difference, considering the DELTAT
C   discretization of use.  Use of  /MEMSAV  has no practical effect in this
C   case because the value keyed on the integer miscellaneous data card is zero.
C   This is deliberate.  Normally,  the field would be left blank,  but if this
C   were the case,  one could not be sure that the  /MEMSAV  flag was working.
C   The user will note that the zero is passed through, demonstrating opeation.

C   30 December 2003,  add  /CYCLE  qualifier to continue to have T-open = 0.0
C   As Orlando Hevia observed in E-mail of that day, this normally is not the
C   engineering choice.  Normally, a switch that closes should remain closed,
C   and DICTAB is being modified to do this.  T-close = 1.E+9  will be seen on
C   the modified switch card.  To restore 0.0,  add  /CYCLE  (which will allow
C   the switch to cycle open again (the status at time zero).
