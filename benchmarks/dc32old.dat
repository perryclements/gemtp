C     BENCHMARK DC-32
C     Artificial  6-pulse  dc  power supply  that  illustrates the simulation of
C     diodes.  It was concocted in July of 1977  to  instruct Hughes Aircraft in
C     Fullerton, California (Emory Johnson, Gene Perusse, and assoc.).   Use  of
C     MEMSAV = 1 dumps tables for later restarting and modification (see DC-49).
C     It is assumed that  STARTUP  has  KTRPL4 < 0  and  L4BYTE = 1  so  that  a
C     C-like ".PL4" file having name  DC32.PL4  will be created (used by DC-49).

C          Small impedance branches are used (prior to "M34." generalized switch
C          logic) to isolate switches from each other at  "POLEA".   R = 5 ohms.
C          Although in theory such isolation is no longer required,  do  not try
C          to remove these 9 resistors,  since  they  provide necessary damping.
C          Note that these resistors are not of negligible value:

C          More small impedances used for switch isolation at node  "POLEB", and
C          also at the transformer secondary. Half the value of "POLEA" is used,
C          for balance:

C      2-conductor distributed line connects  "POLE"  with  "LOAD".   Inductance
C      parameters  are  5.8  and  1.6 millihenries for the ground and sky modes,
C      respectively.  Length is five miles.  Values are typical for 500 kV line:

C     Bridge circuit consisting of 6 uncontrolled valves  (i.e., diodes).  Those
C     numbered  1, 2, and 3  feed  "POLEA",   making it positive with respect to
