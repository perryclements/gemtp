C     Illustration of  "AVERAGE OUTPUT"  usage,  as applied to Hermann's example
C     "Remarks on opening action"  that  is to be found in the Rule Book section 
C     on switches (page 28a for June, 1984 version).  Because of averaging,  the
C     "hash"  that  Hermann's  photograph documents  can  no longer be detected.  
C     Later (2nd and 3rd) subcases are unrelated:  simple  Type-18 source usage.
C     4th subcase shows an alternative to the first, using damping resistors.
C     The 5th of 6 subcases has  IDEAL TRANSFORMER  (internally,  this uses
C     the Type-18 source).  Solution was wrong prior to correction on 25 Feb 01.
C     Finally,  the 6th subcase illustrates the  RECLOSE  feature of switches.

C      degrees  (so when added to external generator,  the total phasor is 1.414
C      at an angle of -45 degrees;   3) Ungrounded voltage source alone.   There
C      is no phasor solution for initial conditions in this 2nd subcase of DC-55

C     6th of 6 subcases illustrates the  RECLOSE  feature of time-controlled
C     switches,  which became available  24 December 2001  as should be
C     described in some future newsletter story (July, 2002 or later).  Data
C     comes from the 4th subcase,  which provides half of the network.  Time
C     is extended (doubled, in fact) to allow reclosing of the switch.  Using
C     old modeling,  this is done by means of a second time-controlled switch
C     in parallel with the first.  Of course, only one switch or the other is
C     closed at any one time  ---  a requirement of switch logic.  The same
C     solution is obtained using new modeling by a  RECLOSE  switch.  Although
C     only two pairs of  (T-close  and  T-open)  are illustrated,  in fact an
C     arbitrary number are allowed.  When ATP is done with one (upon opening),
C     the next pair will replace the preceding pair.  Storage is in List 10, so
C     is variably-dimensioned.  Time-step size  DELTAT  has been doubled simply
C     to speed simulation.  Finally, the source has been rotated 90 degrees to
C     speed the action (no need to waste time waiting for the first opening).
