C        occurs only in the middle (after 20 sections of 5 miles).  An important
C        difference is the series elements.  In the preceding case,  they were
C        used just once.  Here,  they are repeated 20 times.  But since the
C        resistance is so small,  answer is not changed appreciably.  One final
C        difference is the addition of 8 dummy branches to force nodes  NTOT
C        into 3 digits,  which changes the interpretation on  STOP CASCADE.

C    Final line section was split in two.  Originally,  it was approximately one

C    first of the two is defined by the preceding REPETITION loop.  That leaves
C    one single-length section to be connected manually:
