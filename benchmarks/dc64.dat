C     Example drawn from the dynamite EMTP Newsletter article by W. Scott Meyer,
C     "EMTP Data Modularization and  Sorting ...,"   Volume 4,   No. 2,  Sec. V,
C     November, 1983.   $PREFIX   and   $SUFFIX   may be installation-dependent.
C     Miscellaneous  data  cards  and  TACS  have  been added to allow execution
C     to  continue  through  the  reading of switch cards,  thereby  documenting
C     the   $INCLUDE  evaluation and subsequent sorting.   The   $INCLUDE   file
C     DC64INCL.DAT  was  created  by  2nd subcase of companion data case  DC-36. 
C     For  nearly identical case  (except no use of dummy internal nodes,  which
C     makes it less general), see DC-8 (associated with first subcase of DC-36).

C      2nd of 2 subcases will illustrate use of dependent variables within an
C      INCLUDE  file.  The 5th subcase of DC36 involved 3,  and it created the
C      punch file  DC36E.PCH  that now will be used.  Note the 2nd argument is
C      the line-to-line RMS voltage,  which will be assumed to be 500 kV.  This
C      is converted to line-to-neutral peak by dividing by the square root of 3
C      and multiplying by the square root of 2:  500000 * root (2/3) = 408248
