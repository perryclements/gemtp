C        Problem identical to  DC-4,  only  here  the data is modularized to two
C        levels using  $INCLUDE  with arguments (both numeric and alphanumeric).
C     March of 2006,  modify to illustrate  $INSERT  with arguments and "/"-card
C     sorting.  In addition to the original data case,  4 more will be appended
C     and each of these will have its own  $INSERT  disk file.  As for the
C     original first,  it remains the same except that  $INSERT  has replaced
C     the  $INCLUDE  use of years past.  Arguments are unchanged,  however.
C         4 May 2007,  add following  $PREFIX  after modification of  OVER1  and
C         CIMAGE  that moves  CHAR*80 PREFIX  into  BLKCOM  for use by  $INSERT.
C         This allows remote execution, from \UNFORM, without data modification.

C   Comment about 6 lines above.  Note  ENDMODELS  has like the initiation
C   word MODELS:  there is only one of them,  and has nothing to do with
C   the actual modeling.  It is part of the structure in which actual data
C   is carried.  Normally,  ENDMODELS  would precede the blank card ending
C   MODELS,  but with sorting that is not possible.  /-card sorting will
C   put the actual data there.  If we raise  ENDMODELS  line by one row,
C   it would precede all real  MODELS  data,  and that would be completely
C   wrong.  So,  we put it after the blank.  Recall  MODELS  ignores blank
C   lines,  so the blank card ending MODELS is ignored.  It is essential
C   to the sorting,  but then is ignored by MODELS itself.  Since it was
C   optional, anyway, this works well.
