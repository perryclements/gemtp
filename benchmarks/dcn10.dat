C     BENCHMARK DCNEW-10
C       Test of  U.M.  for the option of data that is nearly compatible with the
C       Type-59 S.M.   Like DCNEW-9, only here compensation will NOT be employed
C       Also,  the general interface to send any U.M. variables to TACS will  be
C       illustrated, even though TACS does nothing with those variables.

NAMES ARE LEFT ADJUSTED       { ATP will halt if any A6 name begins with a blank 
C NAMES ARE RIGHT ADJUSTED      { ATP will halt if any A6 name ends with a blank 
C  Left-adjusted names are the most common, but right-adjusted names also are
C  possible as the preceding comment demonstrates.  Protection against failure
C  to do either begins 11 January 2001.  Once turned on,  either service remains
C  in effect unless and/or until the other is declared, or execution ends.  That
C  is why declaration here in the first subcase is sufficient for illustration
C  of  KILL = 81  in the 2nd subcase.

C        Note that the preceding connection was especially simple because  there
C        is no need to be concerned about the number of the U.M. (here, only 1).
C        More generally,  the otherwise unused columns 41-52  have been reserved
C        for the machine variable as  2A6  information.   E.g.,  "UM-1  OMEGM ".  
C        In this case,  note that the name of columns 3-8 is arbitrary.  But for
C        the simple case (here) where columns 41-52 are blank,  the  1st machine
C        that has an output variable matching the name of  columns  3-8  will be
C        accepted for the connection.  The 2nd of 2 connections will follow.  On
C        a comment card, first, will the the simplied form.  It will be followed
C        by the real connection in general form.   Note that  within  TACS,  the
C        U.M. variable  IE1  has been given the name  FIELD:
C 92IE1     { 2nd of 2 Type-92 TACS sources would be this way if simplified form
92FIELD                                 UM-1  IE1 { Connect IE1 of UM-1 to FIELD

C        2nd subcase illustrates halt due to  NAMES ARE LEFT ADJUSTED (NALA)  as
C        left over from the 1st subcase.  Data is from 3rd subcase of DC-20 as 
C        added  11 January 2001.  All TACS variables except 1 have been deleted,
C        and this one (OUT1) has been shifted right by one byte to create an
C        error.  Also,  on the electrical side,  NOD2  has been shifted right 
C        by one byte.  So,  there are two errors.  Either one would be enough
C        to halt execution.

BEGIN NEW DATA CASE
C      Non-existent 3rd data subcase is used only to illustrate termination
C      on a truly blank card.  This will happen because  $BLANK HALT  appears
C      earlier (in fact,  in a preceding data subcase).  As explained in the 
C      October, 1993,  newsletter,  STARTUP  variable  NOBRAN  could be used
C      instead of this  $-card,  which is restricted to just this disk file.
