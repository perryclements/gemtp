C * The fitting parameter part consists of 4 lines.
C * ARMAfit will determin the best order for each phase in the range
C   specified in the above.  The recommended values are :
C     4, 12  for voltage deformation matrix [H]
C     1,  6  for characteristic admittance matrix [Y0]
C   Too big order does not give accurate fitting and stability.
C * The meaning of the error constants above is as follows :
C     EpsA  : permitted error in the stage of Least-Square fitting
C     EpsM1 : error determining modal traveling timings
C     EpsM2 : error detecting dominant modes in each phase response
C   The recommended values are :
C     EpsA = 3.0 %,  EpsM1 = 0.5 %,  EpsM2 = 2.0 %
C   Too small value does not give accurate fitting, because the line
C   parameters given by CABLE PARAMETERS, CABLE CONSTANTS, or LINE
C   CONSTANTS include errors due to many approximations, assumptions,
C   and numerical calculations.  An ARMA model does not reproduce
C   a frequency characteristic which cannot exist physically.
C * If phase #1 and #3 have symmetry regarding to the center line of
C   the line configuration, we can specify as the above, and then
C   ARMAfit will take care of the symmetry to reduce the fitting time.
C   If more than 2 pairs of phases have symmetry, we can specify as
C   follows : 1, 4  2, 5  3, 6  { three pairs.
C * The next part will be the frequency scan from CABLE PARAMETERS,
C   CABLE CONSTANTS, or LINE CONSTANTS.
