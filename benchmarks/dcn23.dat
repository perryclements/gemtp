C       4th of 15 subcases progresses from preceding 2-phase to 3-phase.  Begin
C       with special  Z0Z1Z2  model that assumes decoupled symmetrical component
C       impedances  Zo  for  the  zero sequence,  Z1  for the positive sequence,
C       and finally  Z2  for the negative sequence.   Otherwise, the  problem is
C       the same:  5 very small steps of uncoupled,  resistive voltage dividers.
C       About current outputs,  this subcases introduces selective use of col.
C       80 punches.  Note phase C output of the series R-L-C is missing,  and
C       that this is supplied by the punch on the Type-53 card.  Switching the
C       zero and the 1 of these two phase-C cards does not change the numbers
C       (it only changes the heading names).  That was for the 3rd of 3.  One
C       can change the 2nd (phase B) in comparable fashion without changing
C       numbers of the time-step loop output.  This illustrates selective
C       branch current output.
