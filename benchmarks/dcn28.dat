BEGIN NEW DATA CASE
C     BENCHMARK DCNEW-28
C   Verify correct operation of all of Laurent Dube's own 78 test cases.  Since
C   these date to 1995,  and already exist as separate disk files in a separate
C   directory,  we will continue to use that storage by means of the following
C   request (a comment card, note) which serves to concatenate one data subcase
C   from each of the  $INCLUDE  files named.
C CONCATENATE INCLUDE FILES
C $PREFIX, []    { $INCLUDE files are located in same place as this main data file
$PREFIX, \ld\testmodl\  { $INCLUDE files are located in same place as this main data file
$SUFFIX, .dat       { All files used with  $INCLUDE  end with  .dat  file type
C   Data file  ERRSTP  tests the MODELS error stop in the subroutine of this
C   same name.  At first,  this was placed last,  in case recovery would fail
C   because of the recursive  CALL MAIN10  that Dube used.  But after both
C   Salford and GNU Mingw32 ATP successfully handled 10 such consecutive
C   recoveries in succession,  it was decided that this is the way the standard
C   test case would be left:
$INCLUDE, ERRSTP  ,    { Number 75 of Laurent Dube's own test cases,   1 of 10
$INCLUDE, ERRSTP  ,    { Number 75 of Laurent Dube's own test cases,   2 of 10

C     Warning.  If all the preceding can not be handled by some program version,
C     try deleting 9 of the 10 tries,  and restoring the remaining line to the
C     end,  where it first had been placed.  23 April 2001.  WSM.
