C     The 1st of the 3  STATISTICS  switches has type code "76" which means that
C     the distribution is uniform with mean of 2 msec  and standard deviation of
C     0.1 msec (columns 15 through 34).  The 2nd and 3rd switches have type code
C     zero,  so use Gaussian distribution.  The means are 4 and 6 msec,  and the

C   be forgotten.  The idea is this.  Each EXCLUDE command excludes another shot
C   (number 2 for the preceding).   Deterministic simulation of this often is of
C   interest,  and  DISK  is designed to create such a data file.  The name will
C   be  SHOT0002.DAT  and  this file will be located along with the  .LIS  file,

C          The solution of this 2nd subcase should exactly agree with the first.
C          However , for variety ,  a base case solution (missing from the first
C          subcase)  and  a  character plot have been added to this 2nd subcase.
C          Also,  the  ".PL4"  plot file  (actually,  just the header)  is saved

C          3rd of 6 subcases repeats the first subcase exactly,  only instead of
C          dumping full tables,  MEMSAV = 2  (columns 49-56)  means  that  only  
C          the extrema  and switching times are to be dumped,  and  
C          this will be  FORMATTED  rather than  UNFORMATTED  (for
C          this change, only  $OPEN  is changed).  The resulting card-image file  
C          named  dc24ct40.lis  is used by the 2nd and later subcases of  DC-40.
C          Also, as an illustration,  time-step loop output of all energizations 
C          will be shown (because column-48 variable KSTOUT  is zero not blank),
C          and the miniature character plots of switch times will be suppressed.

C  Preceding STATISTICS miscellaneous data card is handled differently beginning
C  23 September 2005 as new reserved value  IDICE = 2309  is introduced as a
C  request for alternative, computer-dependent dice.  This is to satisfy Apple
C  Macintosh G5 as used by Stu Cook of JUST Services in Ontario, Canada.  As of
C  this date,  Mac G5 ATP is the only version to honor the 2309 alternative.
C  For all versions,  any other IDICE value (including the value unity shown)
C  is treated the same as zero or blank.  I.e.,  any other value does nothing.
C  Henceforth,  IDICE = 2309  is a request for alternative,  computer-dependent
C  random numbers (dice) of the operating system's library.  So,  we illustrate
C  use here to document the two associated warning lines immediately before the
C  input of branch data begins.  If Stu Cook wants to compare his results with
C  everybody else's,  he should restore the value  IDICE = 1  (alternatively,
C  zero or blank would be equivalent).  Salford ATP output follows:
C    Statistics data.      1    1    0    0 2309    1  |       1       1   ...

C       Computer-dependent (not universal) dice have been requested for this
C                          Monte Carlo study by reserved value  IDICE = 2309.
C       Sorry, no alternative computer-dependent dice are available.  ATP will
C                          ignore this request.  Universal dice will be used.

C          However, instead of the  SELECT  function  (which is a generalization
C          of  USER SUPPLIED SWITCH TIMES),  dice will be rolled just as was the
C          case for the 1st subcase.  Yes, the same dice,  with the RAN function
C          and the  GAUSS  function  of the pocket calculator replacing internal
C          rolling that ATP performs in support of  STATISTICS switches.  Within
C          the PCVP loop,  the user must roll his own dice after first ensuring
C          that seeding of the random number generator is identical to what ATP

C    on a fixed time (the WW I Armistice time)  and zero elapsed CP time.  I.e.,
C    program output will be deterministic although different from the output for
C    the data as shown.  That  is because the fixed seed of RRN differs from the
C    fixed seed that results from the WW I time.  Complicated, eh?

C   Diagnostic printout of the 1st subcase reveals that dice are rolled 5 times
C   prior to each energization.  There are 3 STATISTICS switches, so 3 of the 5
C   are used for them.  But prior to these, there are 2 more.  First,  there is
C   a wasted roll that is used for nothing.  This has been known for many years
C   but was not removed for reasons of historical continuity.  Second, there is
C   a roll that is used for the uniform bias that might,  if the user wants it,
C   be added to the closing times of all switches.  So,  here are the 5 rolls :
UNUSE1of2 = GAUSS ( 0.0 ) { OVER12 wastes 1 use for no good reason if STATISTIC
UNUSE2of2 = GAUSS ( 0.0 ) { OVER12 rolls a 2nd time for bias if STATISTICS case
C   Now we are ready for the 3 switches.  The 1st has type code 76, which means
C   a uniform distribution.  This is a little involved because it is low level.
C   The 1st subcase uses a mean of 2 msec and a standard deviation of 0.1 msec.
C   But the  RAN  function produces a uniform distribution over (0, 1).  To map
C   the RAN  output  RNG  into the desired closing time, OVER12 uses this code:
C      RNG = TIMEV + BIAS + SQRT3 *  ABSZ ( TOPEN(NDXI) ) * ( 2.0 * RNG - 1.0 )
C   For this case,  there is no bias  BIAS,  TIMEV is the mean equal to 2 msec,
C   SQRT3  is the square root of 3, and  TOPEN  is the standard deviation.  So:
TCLOSE_AAA = 2.0E-3 + 0.17320508E-3 * ( 2.0 * RAN ( 0.0 ) - 1.0 )  { Uniform closing time of phase "a"
C   This is slightly more efficient,  using the constant  0.17320508E-3  rather
C   than scaling an ATP variable.  But the answers should be identical.  ATP is
C   smart enough to recognize  SQRT3  as a program variable,  and use the full,
C   internal precision associated with it.  Program output will be unchanged if
C   the preceding were replaced by:
C TCLOSE_AAA = 2.0E-3 + SQRT3 * 1.E-4 * ( 2.0 * RAN ( 0.0 ) - 1.0 )  { Uniform closing time of phase "a"
C   Switches 2 and 3 (phases b and c) are easier since they are Gaussian: 
TCLOSE_BBB = 4.0E-3 + 0.5E-3 * GAUSS ( 0.0 )   { Gauss closing time of phase "b"
TCLOSE_CCC = 6.0E-3 + 1.0E-3 * GAUSS ( 0.0 )   { Gauss closing time of phase "c"

C          6th of 6 subcases is added  24 July 2011  to illustrate the new
C          protection against overflow of List 23.  Data is the same as for
C          subcase 1 although the base case has been activated to prove that
C          omission is not a requirement.  Note the  NENERG = 90K  shots of
C          the integer misc. data card.  For other translations,  this is a
C          case of overkill.  But for Salford ATP,  ordered COMMON blocks
C          result in an enormous List 23 in excess of a million words.  For
C          Salford ATP,  such huge  NENERG  is necessary.  WSM.

C      Interpretation of the preceding integer misc. data card is improved on

C      allow the handling of much larger integers. The old format was (2I5, 8I3)
C      which resulted in overflow for  NENERG >  999.  The new is not troubled :
