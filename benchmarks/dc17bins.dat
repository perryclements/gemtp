C    Now that all plotting is done with, let's illustrate the three declarations
C    that will choose the destination  of  any  subsequent  "CALCOMP PLOT"  use:
  SCREEN PLOT  { If a vector plot were to follow, it would go only to the screen
  PEN PLOT     { If a vector plot were to follow, ... go only to CalComp plotter
  SCREEN PEN   { If a vector plot were to follow, .. go to both screen & plotter
C         The preceding 3 declarations really could only be tested by a user who
C         had both a vector-graphic screen and a CalComp plotter.  Hence no use.
C    The following active card of DC-33 must be disabled for $INSERT use.  The
C    problem is this.  For  $INCLUDE,  the  /LOAD FLOW  disappears during data
C    assembly,  leaving just comment cards that have nothing to do with any load
C    flow.  So,  they were tolerated.  But not so for  $INSERT  which retains
C    the data for this non-existent feature.  So, remove entire block:
C /LOAD FLOW

C  Initial conditions really are not a part of this problem, although we do want
C  to illustrate that they,  too,  can be sorted,  and inserted after  /LOADFLOW 
C  The preceding redefinition of node voltage  at  GROUND  changes zero to zero.
