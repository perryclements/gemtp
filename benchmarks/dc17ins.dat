C    Begin illustration of  $DISABLE  usage within an  INCLUDE  file  (in  fact,
C    this is two levels down,  since this  INCLUDE  is called by  dc17inc1.dat).
C    The comments now being read are not part of the test,  so they will be seen
C    (even though they have nothing to do with the data of the network).  All of
C    the remaining cards except the last one  ($ENABLE)  will be omitted as data
C    is first read, so there will be no trace in the interpretation of EMTP data
C    cards except for the  final card,  which will document the number involved.
