Theory behind the EMTP is scattered through various technical
papers and a few books.  The following may be found useful for reference
purposes:

          transients in single and multiphase networks", IEEE Trans., vol.
          PAS 88, pp. 388-399, April 1969.

          simulation of electromagnetic transients", IEEE Trans vol. PAS-90,
          pp. 2561-2567, Nov/Dec 1971.

          dependent transmission line parameters in an electromagnetic
          transients program", IEEE Trans, vol. PAS-93, pp. 1401-1409.

          equations by optimally ordered triangular factorization", Proc.

          transients", Proc. IEEE, vol. 62, pp. 983-993, July 1974.

.. [REF8] W. S. Meyer, "Transients Program Memoranda". Approximately 150
          pages per volume, this concerns the EMTP development memoranda
          which are regular issued as progress made.  Individual memos
          are bound when there has been sufficient accumulation to form
          a volume.  As of Frebruary, 1984, there were 14 volumes.  Only the
          most recent volume is generally available, however, so do not write
          requesting a complete set.  Older volumes are out of print.  When a
          new volume is released, a fixed number of copies are printed;  and
          when these are exhausted, the volume becomes unavailable through
          regular channels (a Freedom of Information request would always be
          honored, of course, but a copying fee would be charged).  As of
          April, 1984, Memoranda writing has been suspended indefinitely
          with the 74-page contribution dated 19#January 1984 (finished on
          25 March 1984) being the final one unless management encourages
          a resumption.  A request for guidance in setting such priorities
          was made of higher management on March 26th, 1984.
